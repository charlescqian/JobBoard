# JobBoard
Job Board Project for CPSC 304 (Group 17)

## Tech Stack
We used ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MySQL for this project. ReactJS was used to create the frontend UI components. Node was used as to interface with our MySQL database. While ExpressJS was used to create API endpoints to fetch the data from the backend to the frontend UI components.

## Resources Used
Dashboard template is from https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/templates/dashboard. We used this as a starter code for the frontend and built on top of it.
